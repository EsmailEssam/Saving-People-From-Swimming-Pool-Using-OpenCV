# Saving-People-From-Swimming-Pool-Using-YOLOv8
## Introduction
This project is designed to assist lifeguards and pool owners in monitoring swimming pools more effectively. By utilizing advanced AI algorithms, this project aims to reduce the likelihood of drowning accidents. The application uses a camera to constantly monitor the pool area, analyzing swimmers' movements and poses to identify potential distress or drowning scenarios.

## Features
* **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuous analysis of the swimming pool using a camera.
* **Multi-Pose Estimation:** Utilizes YOLOv8 for efficient and accurate multi-pose estimation.
* **Drowning Detection:** Detects unusual movements or poses that indicate a swimmer might be in danger.
* **Alert System:** Instantly alerts the lifeguard or responsible individual when a potential drowning is detected.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use interface for setting up and monitoring the system.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
* Python 3.8 or later
* OpenCV
* YOLOv8
* Additional Python libraries as listed in `requirements.txt`
